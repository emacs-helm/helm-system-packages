* Introduction

Helm System Packages is an Emacs-based interface to the package manager of your
operating system /and/ remote systems as well.

Emacs' knowledge is not required: see the [[stand-alone][stand-alone]] folder for a version targeted at
non-Emacs users.  Run the script and everything should be self-explanatory.  If
not then it's a bug, please report it.

Start ~helm-system-packages~ to list all available packages (with installed
packages as well as dependencies displayed in their own respective face).
Fuzzy-search, mark and execute the desired action over any selections of
packages:

- Install.
- Uninstall.
- Display packages details (in Org Mode!) or insert details at point.
- Find files owned by packages.
- And much more, including performing all the above over the network!

Helm System Packages provides a uniform interface over the following package
managers:

- =brew=    (Macos)
- =dnf=     (Rpm packages, Fedora etc...)
- =dpkg=    (Deb packages, Debian and derived)
- =guix=    (Guix manager)
- =pacman=  (ArchLinux and derived)
- =portage= (Gentoo and derived)
- =xbps=    (Void linux)
- And (hopefully) more to come!  Contributions are welcome.

Some package managers come with their specific actions and even specific
Helm sources, e.g. Portage's USE flags.

NOTES: Due to the lack of developpers to maintain these packages only
the pacman and dpkg modules are maintained.

* Usage

There is only one entry point: ~helm-system-packages~.

Use the persistent action to view the details of the marked packages.

Most actions can be called with a prefix argument to insert the result at point.

If started from a remote TRAMP buffer (e.g. dired, Eshell or just any remote
file), ~helm-system-packages~ automatically switches to the packages of the
remote system.  The remote package manager can be different from the local one.

** Maintenance & other operations

Helm System Packages only works over lists of packages.  It does not feature any
maintenance-related operations such as cleaning the cache or synchronizing the
database.

[[https://github.com/jabranham/system-packages][system-packages]] is an Emacs package providing Emacs with universal commands for
such operations.
It is unrelated to Helm System Packages but both work well together.

** Privileges

Transactions such as installing and removing packages are run via the `sudo`
command in Eshell.
If you'd like to cache the password for, say, an hour, you can configure Eshell
to use its own version of sudo via TRAMP:

: (require 'em-tramp)
: (setq password-cache t)
: (setq password-cache-expiry 3600)

* Motivation

Most of the package managers GUIs out there do not provide much efficiency over
their commandline counterparts.

The commandline workflow is centered around a cumbersome try-repeat loop:

1. Search for local packages.
2. Package missing?  Search for remote packages.
3. List is too long?  Pipe through a pager.
4. (Un)install the desired package by writing the searched package names again.

With Helm all those actions get factored into one.
Helm sessions can also be resumed.

* Screencasts

- Display information of multiple packages in an Org buffer, resume the search and finally install.

- Use Helm to find files of multiple packages across different sources.

- Use Helm to explore the graph of the (reverse) dependencies.

* Development

*WARNING:* The programming interface is still under development and is prone to
change.

Each module is rather straightforward, it only needs to define the following:

- A ~helm-system-packages-FOO-dependencies~ var that store the needed
  executables to use.

- An ~helm-system-packages-FOO-refresh~ function which
  will be used by the ~helm-system-packages-refresh~ function.

- A ~helm-system-packages-FOO~ variable that handle the necessary data
  to build the helm source (use ~helm-system-packages-manager-create~
  to build it).
